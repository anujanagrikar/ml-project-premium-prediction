# 🏥 Predictive Health Insurance Premium Model

A Machine Learning-based system designed to estimate health insurance premiums based on customer risk factors using data-driven modeling techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate health insurance premiums using customer attributes such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and medical history.

Traditionally, premium estimation can involve manual underwriting processes, which may be time-consuming and inconsistent. This solution leverages Machine Learning to automate premium prediction, improve accuracy, and enable faster decision-making through an interactive web application.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User inputs customer details such as age, BMI, smoking status, and medical history.
2. The trained Machine Learning model processes the input features.
3. The system predicts the estimated health insurance premium.
4. The predicted premium is displayed instantly in the Streamlit interface.
